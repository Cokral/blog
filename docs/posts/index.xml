      <description>Today, I find myself working on another Machine Learning (ML) model with the goal of putting it in production. I thought a good first step would be to look back on my previous experiences and identify what (not) to do!
I wonâ€™t explain what ML is in this article, or which algorithm(s) to pick according to different cases; Iâ€™ll go through good practices like: how to start, what not to forget about and little tricks to make your life easier.</description>

      <description>Hello there / bonjour ðŸ‘‹ I am Thomas, a 26yo French Data Scientist and this is my first ever blog post !
This blog will be about everything, from what I learnt after 3 years working as a Data Scientist, to random thoughts about the world !
For years, I have been passionate about self improvement. Trying to find ways to combine pleasure, entertainment and self growth. Back in high school, I decided to better my English and picked-up the Hobbit in its original version.</description>
