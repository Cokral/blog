Hello there / bonjour ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Thomas, a 26yo French Data Scientist and this is my first ever blog post ! 

This blog will be about everything, from what I learnt after 3 years working as a Data Scientist, to random thoughts about the world !

For years, I have been passionate about self improvement. Trying to find ways to combine pleasure, entertainment and self growth. Back in high school, I decided to better my English and picked-up the Hobbit in its original version. At the time, Iâ€™d note down in a notebook every single word I didnâ€™t know, along with its definition. And every night, before starting to read again, Iâ€™d go through the list from the beginning. With this blog, I want to go back to continuous improvement by writing on a weekly basis, and material using into words my experiences and thoughts.

See you next week, 

Thomas
